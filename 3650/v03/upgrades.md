Upgrades for programming:

## Touch typing
 
 - Two finger typing: 30 WPM
 - Touch typing: 60 WPM
 - 90% of time programming isn't typing
 - So the upgrade would be 10% of your time
   instead takes 5% of your time.
 - So maybe touch typing speeds you up by 5%
 - Just this class: 6hrs/week * 12 weeks
   = 72 hours - round up to 100
 - Just in this class, touch typing would
   save you five hours.

## Other upgrades   

 - Spending some time learning and configuring
   a powerful editor.
   - I'm not convinced by "autocomplete".
   - Keyboard-focus
 - Becoming familiar with language and libraries
 - Learn the environment's debugger 
   (GDB for C on Linux)
