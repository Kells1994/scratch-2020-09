# Plans for using the Mbot Ranger

Key complication: The robot is an Arduino

 - Slow embedded processor
 - 8k of RAM
 - 256k of program storage space
 
How do we run bigger programs?

 1. Don't, just use the arduino.
 2. Run your main control program on a computer.
    - Best: Connected by Bluetooth
    - Worst: Connected by a Wire
 3. Run your main control program on a phone.
